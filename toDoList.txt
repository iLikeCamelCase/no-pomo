To implement:

1. Static tracker for amount of pomodoros completed, should remain visible always
2. Options to pause/reset timer while it's running
3. Options to leave the program
5. Fix timer when seconds are <10 eg. 10:03 instead of 10:3, same with mins
(DONE) Beep on timer completion
(DONE) Speaking of the timer, its garbage, come up with a new one

For the future:

1. Persistent storage to track amount of pomodoros completed
2. Visual representation of above ^, show productivity over time.

Bugs:

1. When you minimize terminal window quickly and the cursor moves down a line
it fucks everything up has to do with the "\r" you're using
